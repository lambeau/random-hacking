chat.c:
    The only thing notable here is that to get the IP of the host for the server version of the program, gethostbyname() was used. I read that this is deprecated and there is a better way to get the information, but wasn't able to get it to work properly. If I understand it correctly, gethostbyname() uses the hosts file. This gives a nice IP on the CS machines, but on my home computer where there wasn't an entry for my machine resulted in a 127... address.
    
    Running:
        ./chat
            --starts a chat server
        ./chat -s [host] -p [port]
            --starts a chat client that connects to the specified host:port combo
    
Makefile:
    'make' compiles the program and outputs the executable 'chat'
    'make clean' removes the executable and object files
